==========

An heuristic toolbox for spying<sup>*</sup> intertidal crabs in their environment; built in Python. In continuous development.

<sup>*</sup> Furtively collect information about crabs functional biology and ecology: species identity, movement patterns, change in coloration, feeding rates, bioturbation, and more. 


> *"Until comparatively recently, ecologists were content to describe how nature “looks” (sometimes by means of fantastic
 terms!) and to speculate on what she might have looked like in the past or may look like in the future. 
 Now, an equal emphasis is being placed on what nature ‘does’, and rightly so, because the changing face 
 of nature can never be understood unless her metabolism is also studied. This change in approach brings 
 the small organisms into perspective with the large, and encourages the use of experimental methods to 
 supplement the analytic. It is evident that so long as a purely descriptive viewpoint is maintained, 
 there is very little in common between such structurally diverse organisms as sperma-tophytes, 
 vertebrates and bacteria. In real life, however, all these are intimately linked functionally in 
 ecological systems, according to well-defined laws. Thus the only kind of general ecology is that which
 I call a ‘functional ecology’..."*
